To get started with structuring data, explore working with an enumeration.

## Days

Enumerations allow you to capture a list of options within a program. To test this out let's create an enumeration to represent days of the week. We can call this enumeration `day`, and it can have options for Monday, Tuesday, etc.

To test this out create a new C++ program and declare within this the new enumeration. For the moment, we need to declare the new type and use it to create a variable in `main`.

Complete the following code by declaring the `day` enumeration, and ensuring it has a value for each day. Remember that these values are like constants, so in C/C++ our coding convention would be to use UPPER_CASE. We can make use of our [utilities](/book/part-2-organised-code/2-organising-code/1-tour/04-00-utilities) to help with reading details from the user.

```cpp
#include "splashkit.h"
#include "utilities.h"

using std::to_string;

// add enumeration here called 'day'

int main()
{
    // Enum variable declaration
    day today;

    // Assigning a value to the enum variable
    today = WEDNESDAY;

    // Print the value of today
    write_line("Today is day number " + to_string(today));

    return 0;
}
```

enum day
{
    SUNDAY,
    MONDAY,
    TUESDAY,
    WEDNESDAY,
    THURSDAY,
    FRIDAY,
    SATURDAY
};
```

## Converting to string

At the moment the output is less than ideal, as we can only have the numeric value of the enum. To change this we can develop a function to convert an enum value to a string.

|   |   |
|---|---|
| **Function** | *to string* |
| **Parameters** | `d`: The day to convert |
| **Returns** | A string representation of the day to convert |
| **Description** | Convert the day (d) to a string. |

We can implement `to_string` using a [switch](/book/part-1-instructions/3-control-flow/2-trailside/03-2-case) statement, with one branch per value in the enumeration.

Naming this `to_string` also means `main` will not need to be changed. When you compile and run this it should output the day of the week, rather than the enum's raw integer value.

```cpp
#include "splashkit.h"
#include "utilities.h"

using std::to_string;

// add enumeration here called 'day'

// add to_string here

int main()
{
    // Enum variable declaration
    day today;

    // Assigning a value to the enum variable
    today = WEDNESDAY;

    // Print the value of today
    write_line("Today is " + to_string(today));

    return 0;
}
```

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem
    header="Code to convert day to string"
  >

```cpp
/**
 * Converts the given day enum value to a string representation.
 *
 * @param d The day enum value to convert.
 * @return The string representation of the day.
 */
string to_string(day d)
{
  switch (d)
  {
    case SUNDAY:
      return "Sunday";
    case MONDAY:
      return "Monday";
    case TUESDAY:
      return "Tuesday";
    case WEDNESDAY:
      return "Wednesday";
    case THURSDAY:
      return "Thursday";
    case FRIDAY:
      return "Friday";
    case SATURDAY:
      return "Saturday";
    default:
      return "Invalid day";
  }
}
```

While we are using this here to convert an enum value to a string, the same style of logic can be used elsewhere in your code. With the enum you know the potential range of values, so these will work well in conditional logic.

*What about invalid day?*

Each enumeration is implemented as an integer value, this means it is possible that the value does not match to one of the enum values. As a result you must always make sure to cover the case where your value does not match the expected options.

## Reading data from the user

To wrap up this test, we can also look at converting data in the other direction. This function can be called to read a day from the user. This will display the list of days, and their values allowing the user to select the day they are after.

|   |   |
|---|---|
| **Function** | *read day* |
| **Parameters** | `prompt`: The message to display when reading the day |
| **Returns** | The day entered by the user |
| **Description** | Displays the prompt, and list of days for the user to select from. Data input is validated, and the selected day value is returned. |

The following is a start of the `main` to test this, with `read_day` being called to populate the today variable.

When implementing `read_day`, you can use a loop to simplify printing each of the days manually. Inside the loop you can convert the integer to the enum value and then convert that to a string. This way you could apply the same style of logic to enumerations with any number of options.

Have a go at implementing this, and then test the ability to read and write enumeration values using the main below.

```cpp
#include "splashkit.h"
#include "utilities.h"

using std::to_string;

// add enumeration here called 'day'

// add a constant NUM_DAYS to capture number of days in a week

// add to_string here

// add read day here

int main()
{
    // Enum variable declaration
    day today;

    // Assigning a value to the enum variable
    today = read_day("What day is it today? ");

    // Print the value of today
    write_line("Today is " + to_string(today));

    return 0;
}
```

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem
    header="Code for read day"
  >

```cpp
const int NUM_DAYS = (int)SATURDAY + 1;

/**
 * Reads a day from the user.
 *
 * @return The day entered by the user.
 */
day read_day(string prompt)
{
    int day_number;
    write_line(prompt);

    // Output the list of day options
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_DAYS; i++)
    {
        day current_day = (day)i;
        write_line(to_string(i + 1) + ": " + to_string(current_day));
    }

    // Read day as a number - 1 to 7
    // Subtract 1 so that it is 0 to 6
    // Use read integer with range if you have it!
    day_number = read_integer("Enter a day number (1-7): ") - 1;
    return (day)day_number;
}
```

With these functions implemented you have seen the different ways of working with enumeration values. These provide convenient types for cases where a value should be selected from a list of options.

## Test it out

Enumerations are fairly simple types, but they can be useful in helping make your code more readable. At this stage you could have a quick look at the [mouse_input.h](https://github.com/splashkit/splashkit-core/blob/develop/coresdk/src/coresdk/mouse_input.h) file that is part of the SplashKit library. Near the top of this code you will find the `mouse_button` enumeration. Notice how this helps document the different buttons that are supported by the SplashKit library.
