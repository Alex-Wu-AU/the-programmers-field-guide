Try converting the most recent version of your [change calculator](/book/part-1-instructions/3-control-flow/1-tour/2-0-change-calculator) to C/C++.
The logic of the program should remain the same, the syntax will just look a little different.

The change of library does mean that you cannot use C#'s `ToInt32` method.
However, C provides an equivalent called [stoi](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/stol) which also converts text to an integer. This works just like `ToInt32`, so you can replace that code with `stoi`, and it should work as it did before.

Have a go yourself.
