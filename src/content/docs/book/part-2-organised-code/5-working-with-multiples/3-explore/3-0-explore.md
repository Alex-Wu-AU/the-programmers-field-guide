With arrays, you now have the all the main tools needed to start building larger programs. Build one or more of the following programs to demonstrate how you can use arrays to manage data within your program.

- [Product Database](/book/part-2-organised-code/5-working-with-multiples/3-explore/3-1-database) - create a small program that maintains a shop's product catalogue.
- [Music player](/book/part-2-organised-code/5-working-with-multiples/3-explore/3-2-music-player) - create the code for a iPod like music player.
- [Rock dodge](/book/part-2-organised-code/5-working-with-multiples/3-explore/3-3-game) - create a small game where the player dodges falling obstacles.

:::caution

All of these programs use a mix of arrays and structs, if you don't yet feel confident mixing structs and arrays, you should first look at the statistics calculator. Try adding in some additional calculations, and this will let you play around with arrays of numbers.
