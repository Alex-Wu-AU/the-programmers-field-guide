The last function is `Main`. This is responsible for coordinating the actions of the program. It will call `Play Game` in a loop that repeatedly plays the game until the user decides to quit. `Main` will have one local variable called `again`. This will store the text, and will be used to store the value read from the user's response to the '*play again*' prompt.

:::note

Computers cannot generate truly random numbers. Instead, it uses a numeric sequence that appears to be random. Seeding the generator with the current time ensures that this random sequence starts at a different value each time the program is run. SplashKit seeds the number generator using the current time when you start using it.

The following pseudocode shows the steps in main.

```
