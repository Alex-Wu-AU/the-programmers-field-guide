title: Test your knowledge

Having explore how we can organise code to help make the code in your programs easier to manage, now you need to test your understanding of what you have seen. Build one or more of these programs to demonstrate how to create and use functions and procedures:

- [AFL game data](/book/part-2-organised-code/2-organising-code/3-explore/3-1-afl-score) - create functions and procedures to calculate AFL scores and game details.
- [Click game with player profile](/book/part-2-organised-code/2-organising-code/3-explore/3-2-player-profile) - create functions and procedures to set up a player profile within a small target hitting game.
