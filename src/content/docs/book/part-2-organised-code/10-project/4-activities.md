### Creating a Tile-Based RPG

In this project, you will need to develop a Tile-Based Role Playing Game (RPG) where the screen will be separated up into different square tiles in which the player can move between these tiles. Tiles can be either traversable or non-traversable such as water and grass. Non-Player Characters will spawn randomly throughout the world which the Player Character will be able to interact with in a way you choose. The game will include Quests and the Player Character will have an inventory which stores items to be used with these Quests.

Your program needs to:

- Draw the Tile-Based world where each tile will be represented by a differently coloured squares
- Spawn the character onto an appropriate starting tile
- Spawn a random number of NPCs throughout the world on appropriate tiles
- NPCs should randomly traverse tiles throughout the world at random intervals, only entering appropriate tiles
- Include a Quest System, which is randomly generated upon game start and upon finishing the previous quest
- Include items which spawn randomly throughout the world on appropriate tiles, these items are used for quests and can be collected by the player character
