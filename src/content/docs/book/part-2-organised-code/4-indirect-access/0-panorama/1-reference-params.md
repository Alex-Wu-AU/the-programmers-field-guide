title: Reference Parameters
---

On the first pass through this chapter, the main thing to start to explore using are reference parameters.


:::note

- A reference is a kind of variable, one that refers to another location in memory.
- In C++, when you read or write to the reference, it actually updates the location it refers to.
- You can, therefore, use a reference to update values passed to it. This is useful for parameters, allowing you to create procedures that update values in memory.
