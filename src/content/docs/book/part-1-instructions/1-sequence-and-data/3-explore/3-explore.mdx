Having explored this leg of the journey you are now approaching a rest stop and a chance to practice and reflect.

## Test Your Knowledge

Create one of the following programs:

- [Test Your Knowledge](#test-your-knowledge)
  - [Own Program](#own-program)
  - [Unit Converter](#unit-converter)
  - [Sound Player](#sound-player)
  - [Game Splash Screen](#game-splash-screen)

### Own Program


### Unit Converter

<div class="not-content">
  <YouTube id="R3xeYNt0dNg" params="fs=1&modestbranding=1&rel=0&autoplay=1"/>
</div>

Here we will be putting together everything we learned across this chapter into something that might help us -- a unit converter!

In this task, it is up to you to create a program that takes in a number of millimeters and converts them into the metric units for centimeters, meters, and kilometers, as well as imperial units for inches, feet, and miles.

For your reference, there are:

- 10 millimeters in a centimeter.
- 100 centimeters in a meter.
- 1000 meters in a kilometer.
- 25.4 millimeters in an inch.
- 12 inches in a foot.
- 5280 feet in a mile.

Your program should:

- Ask the user how many millimeters they would like to convert.
- Print out the resultant conversions for both metric and imperial units.

### Sound Player

<div class="not-content">
  <YouTube id="yJFxHGRBisM" params="fs=1&modestbranding=1&rel=0&autoplay=1"/>
</div>

Here we will be trying out some SplashKit functionality and playing a song (or part thereof) back to us!

In this task, it is up to you to create a program which plays part of an audio file for us.
You might find it helpful to revisit the page on [playing music in SplashKit](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence-and-data/2-trailside/11-3-audio) for this task.

Your program should:

- Ask the user for the path to a song file.
- Ask the user for a name for the song.
- Ask the user how long they would like the song to play for (in seconds).
- Play the song for specified amount of time at 50% volume.
- Play the song for specified amount of time at 100% volume.

### Game Splash Screen

<div class="not-content">
  <YouTube id="M1q6L2Q9IlU" params="fs=1&modestbranding=1&rel=0&autoplay=1"/>
</div>

Here we will be creating the beginning of any good game: a splash-screen/title animation!

In this task, it is up to you to create a short sequence of SplashKit method calls (drawing shapes, colours, images, and delays) to act as an introduction or title animation to a game.
You might find it helpful to revisit the page on [drawing in SplashKit](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence-and-data/2-trailside/11-2-graphics/#drawing-to-a-window) for this task.

Your program should:

- Welcome the user to the game with an appropriate title.
- Play an introductory animation using shapes, colors, and delays.
