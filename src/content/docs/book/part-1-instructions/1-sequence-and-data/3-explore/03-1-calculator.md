Build a savings calculator that when run will show output based on what is shown below.

```txt
What are you saving for? Enter title: Holiday
How much do you need to save? Enter dollars: 2572

How long before the purchase? Enter weeks: 10
How much do you have already? Enter dollars: 2
How much can you save each week? Enter dollars: 50

For the Holiday, you need to save 257.0 dollars a week
Based on current savings you will need 51.4 weeks to save $2572
```

Or build a similar terminal based program of your own design. It will need to:

- read text and numeric data from the user - at least three values.
- perform a calculation involving multiple steps, with outputs shown at each step
- output the results

:::caution
Make sure to only use the things we have covered. Don't worry about formatting the numbers in the output for now, just focus on getting the variables and sequence of method calls right.
