Complete the house by adding in the rectangle and triangle. Here are the relevant coordinates:

- Rectangle: use `ColorGray()`, draw at 300,300, with a width of 200, and a height of 200.
- Triangle: use `ColorRed()`, draw with points at 250,300, and 400,150, and 550,300.


<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem header="House drawn">

  ```cs {8-9}
  using static System.Convert;
  using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;

  OpenWindow("House Drawing by Andrew", 800, 600);

  ClearScreen(ColorWhite());
  FillEllipse(ColorBrightGreen(), 0, 400, 800, 400);
  FillRectangle(ColorGray(), 300, 300, 200, 200);
  FillTriangle(ColorRed(), 250, 300, 400, 150, 550, 300);

  RefreshScreen();

  Delay(5000);
  ```
