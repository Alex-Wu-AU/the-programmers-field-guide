Next, let's calculate the current average speed.

```txt {7-8}
What is your name: Andrew

Hi Andrew.

How far have you travelled so far? Enter km: 5.2
How long has it taken? Enter minutes: 7

Your average speed is 44.57142857142857 km/h
```

1. New variables and constants?

    We will need to store the speed. We can calculate this as `distance` divided by, `time` divided by 60. Where 60 represents minutes per hour.

    We can track the speed by adding a `speed` variable, but we should also add a `MINUTES_PER_HOUR` constant to make this meaningful in our code.

2. Add the code to calculate the speed and output the speed.

    :::tip
    Code `MINUTES_PER_HOUR` above the other variables. It is good to keep constants and variables together. Remember to watch the case you use `camelCase` for variables, and `UPPER_CASE` for constants.

    <Accordion>
      <AccordionItem header="Calculating speed">

    ```cs {4-5,27-31}
    using static System.Convert;
    using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;

    const int MINUTES_PER_HOUR = 60;

    string name;
    string userInput;
    double distance, time;
    double speed;

    Write("What is your name: ");
    name = ReadLine();

    WriteLine();

    WriteLine($"Hi {name}.");

    WriteLine();

    Write("How far have you travelled so far? Enter km: ");
    userInput = ReadLine();
    distance = ToDouble(userInput);

    Write("How long has it taken? Enter minutes: ");
    userInput = ReadLine();
    time = ToDouble(userInput);

    speed = distance / (time / MINUTES_PER_HOUR);

    WriteLine();
    WriteLine($"Your average speed is {speed} km/h");
    ```

      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>

3. Compile and run your program. Check the output matches what we are after.

    :::note

    Make sure to check your calculations. Is the output correct?
