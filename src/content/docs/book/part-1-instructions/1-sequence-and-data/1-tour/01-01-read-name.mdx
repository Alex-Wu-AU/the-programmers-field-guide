import { Accordion, AccordionItem } from 'accessible-astro-components'

Best first step is to build something small, then we can grow the program our from that start. Let's just get the first two messages handled - reading the user's name and displaying it. So we want to see this at the end:

```txt
What is your name: Andrew

Hi Andrew.
```

1. Open your terminal, and setup your project

    ```zsh
    # Move you your code projects folder
    cd ~/Documents/Code # or cd /c/Users/andrew/Documents/Code
    
    # Create and move into a folder for the project
    mkdir TravelCalculator
    cd TravelCalculator

    # Create a blank dotnet project
    dotnet new console
    
    # Add the SplashKit library
    dotnet add package splashkit

    # Open in VS Code
    code .
    ```

2. Add the [using directives](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence-and-data/0-panorama/1-method-library) to access the SplashKit and Convert code.

    <Accordion>
      <AccordionItem header="Code with using directives">

    At this point you should just have these two lines of code.

    ```csharp
    using static System.Convert;
    using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;
    ```

      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>

    As you look at this you want to see if there are any values that will change. We will need to create [variables](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence-and-data/0-panorama/3-variables) to store these.

    Looking at the first lines, I imagine that we may have different users run this. So their name may change.

    :::tip[What type of data would this be?]
    Is this a string, int, or double? String is for text, int whole numbers, and double for real numbers.
    :::

3. Add the code to create a `name` variable - then we can think about how we use this.
4. Review the messages we want to output. To start we want to output the message `"What is your name: "`, read the text and user enters, then output a blank line and the greeting text `"Hi "` followed by the user's name.
  
    Looking back at the [terminal methods](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence-and-data/0-panorama/6-terminal-method-to-use), we have methods to output text (`Write` and `WriteLine`), and read text from the user (`ReadLine`). Use these to display the prompt, and output the required messages.

    <Accordion>
      <AccordionItem header="Reading and using the user name">

    ```cs {3-10}
    using static System.Convert;
    using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;

    string name;
    Write("What is your name: ");
    name = ReadLine();

    WriteLine();
    WriteLine($"Hi {name}.");
    WriteLine();
    ```

      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>

5. Now compile and run the program to see the output. Check it against what we were aiming to achieve.

    :::note

    Notice how you have a sequence of instructions, and can use variables to store data. Try entering different names.
