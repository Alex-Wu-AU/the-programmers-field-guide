The first step in building a graphical program is to open a window. We can then draw onto this. In order to see the picture, we need to also keep the window around for a few seconds before the program ends.

1. Add a call to open a window that we can draw onto.

    In SplashKit you can open a window to draw onto. To open the window you call the `OpenWindow` method, and pass it the windowâ€™s title, its width and its height.

    :::tip[Title and size?]
    You can give the window any title and size. Common sizes are usually in 4:3 such as 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, or widescreen at 16:9 such as 1280x720, or 1920x1080.

    For this use the title "House Drawing by ..." and add your name, with a width of 800 and a height of 600.
    :::

2. If the program ends after the window is open, then it wont be around for long enough for the user to see. To fix this we can use the `Delay` method. You pass it an integer argument for the number of milliseconds to delay. Try delaying for 5000 milliseconds.

    <Accordion>
      <AccordionItem header="Open a window and delay">

      ```cs {3-6}
      using static System.Convert;
      using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;

      OpenWindow("House Drawing by Andrew", 800, 600);

      Delay(5000);
      ```

      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>

3. Compile and run your program. You should see a window open. It should be rectangular, and have the title you set. After five seconds it should close.
