Let's get coding. Programming is a practical skill, so one of the best ways to learn this is through doing it.

There are the following parts to this guided tour:

- Learn to use terminal methods by building a travel calculator
- Learn to use graphical methods by building a house drawing
- Explore this further with a change calculator

At the end of this you should feel confident building small programs that interact with the user via the terminal and have a graphical output.
