Control flow gives us a whole range of opportunities to create dynamic and interactive programs. In this chapter we explored several control flow concepts, and it may take you some time to understand them. That's okay! We encourage you to put in the time and effort now to really understand how to **use** these ideas.

This section will guide you through the process of applying these ideas across two different programs. Here your focus should be on the way you think and approach problems, and the ways in which the different control flow mechanisms can come together to produce different effects.
