In Sequence and Data, we were able to use a number of methods from the .NET System libraries and SplashKit in order to produce outputs and read values from the user. Now that we have control flow, there are a number of additional methods that you can use to help with your projects.

## Terminal Methods

<div class="not-content">
  <YouTube id="ozp3oUHEidg" params="fs=1&modestbranding=1&rel=0&autoplay=1"/>
</div>

In addition to `WriteLine`, `Write`, `ReadLine`, and the convert methods we will now need ways to check if data provided has the right format. The .NET library doesn't have the best 

```cs
public static bool SplashKit.IsDouble(string text);
public static bool SplashKit.IsInteger(string text);
```

These methods will allow you to test if a string can be converted to an integer or a double. You can use these to perform simple validations, by using this as the condition in a loop. For example, the following validates the entry of a double value.

```cs
using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;
using static System.Convert;

string line;
double value;

Write("Please enter a number: ");
line = ReadLine();
while (!IsDouble(line))
{
  WriteLine($"Sorry, I cannot convert {line} to a number.");
  Write("Please enter a number: ");
  line = ReadLine();
}
value = ToDouble(line);

WriteLine($"Thanks you I got {value}");
```

:::caution
Both SplashKit and Console provide `WriteLine`, `Write`, and `ReadLine` methods. To avoid getting the compiler confused just have `using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;` and do not add the code to use `System.Console`.

## Multimedia Methods

</div>

With the more interactive programs using SplashKit there are now a whole range of methods that we can use to check for user inputs, and to help test different aspect of our game (such as time passing, and detecting collisions).

The methods we will need in this chapter include:

- Event loop methods:
  - [Process Events](https://splashkit.io/api/input/#process-events) - listens for actions that the user has performed such as keystrokes, mouse clicks, quitting, etc.
  - [Quit Requested](https://splashkit.io/api/input/#quit-requested) - returns true when the user has asked to close the program.

- Key input methods:
  - [Key Down](https://splashkit.io/api/input/#key-down) - allows you to test if a key is held down.

- Random number methods:
  - [Rnd](https://splashkit.io/api/utilities/#rnd) - Generate a random number.

- Time management methods:
  - [Create Timer](https://splashkit.io/api/timers/#create-timer) - create a timer to keep track of time.
  - [Start Timer](https://splashkit.io/api/timers/#start-timer) - start a timer ticking. You can then query it for how long has passed since it was started.
  - [Timer Ticks](https://splashkit.io/api/timers/#timer-ticks) - tells you how long has passed since the timer was started.

- Collision detection methods:
  - [Circles Intersect](https://splashkit.io/api/geometry/#circles-intersect-2) - test if two circles intersect.
  - [Triangle Rectangle Intersect](https://splashkit.io/api/geometry/#triangle-rectangle-intersect) - test if a triangle and rectangle intersect.
  - [Rectangle From](https://splashkit.io/api/geometry/#rectangle-from-3) - create a rectangle from a given point, width, and height.
  - [Triangle From](https://splashkit.io/api/geometry/#triangle-from-2) - create a triangle from a given set of points.

These methods have the following declarations:

```cs
// These needs...
// using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;

// Event loop
public static void ProcessEvents();
public static bool QuitRequested();

// Key input
// This also requiers... to get access to the KeyCode details.
// using SplashKitSDK;
public static bool KeyDown(KeyCode key);

// Random numbers
public static float Rnd(); // 0 to 1
public static int Rnd(int ubound); // 0 to ubound - 1
public static int Rnd(int min, int max); // min to max


// Time tracking
public static Timer CreateTimer(string name);
public static void StartTimer(string name);
public static uint TimerTicks(string name);

// Collision detection
public static bool CirclesIntersect(double c1X, double c1Y, double c1Radius, double c2X, double c2Y, double c2Radius);
public static bool TriangleRectangleIntersect(Triangle tri, Rectangle rect);
public static Rectangle RectangleFrom(double x, double y, double width, double height);
public static Triangle TriangleFrom(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2, double x3, double y3);
```

### Key Codes

For the `KeyDown` method, you need to tell it which key you are wanting to check. SplashKit provides a list of key codes in a `KeyCode` type, which provides a list of values you can choose from. You should be able to see these in VS Code using its IntelliSense, just make sure you have `using SplashKitSDK;` so that you can see the `KeyCode`.

The main options include:
