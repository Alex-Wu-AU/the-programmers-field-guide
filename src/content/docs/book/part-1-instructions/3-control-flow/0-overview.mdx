The next part of the journey will be spectacular! We are going to see how to take control of the sequence of instructions that the computer runs. This will greatly enhance what you can do with the computer, giving you the tools you need to start building much more interesting programs.

So far you have seen how to create [programs](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence-and-data/1-concepts/00-program) and [variables](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence-and-data/1-concepts/07-variable) using code, and the key instructions of [method calls](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence-and-data/1-concepts/03-method-call) and [assignment statements](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence-and-data/1-concepts/08-assignment-statement). This chapter will introduce you to a range **control flow statements**, which allow you to alter the order in which the computer performs instructions.

In this part of the journey, we will examine the following new instructions and how we can use them in programs:

- [Compound Statement](/book/part-1-instructions/3-control-flow/1-concepts/02-0-compound-statement): groups statements together.
- [If Statement](/book/part-1-instructions/3-control-flow/1-concepts/03-1-if): run some code if a condition is true.
- [Case Statement](/book/part-1-instructions/3-control-flow/1-concepts/03-2-case): selectively run a branch of code.
- [While Loop](/book/part-1-instructions/3-control-flow/1-concepts/04-1-while-loop): loop after testing a condition.
- [Do While Loop](/book/part-1-instructions/3-control-flow/1-concepts/04-2-do-while): loop then test a condition.
- [For Loop](/book/part-1-instructions/3-control-flow/1-concepts/04-3-for-loop): loop a specific number of times.

In addition to these actions, you will be introduced to at a new data type:

- [Boolean](/book/part-1-instructions/3-control-flow/1-concepts/01-0-boolean-data): a [data type](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence-and-data/1-concepts/06-type) representing a *true* or *false* value.

To help with these concepts, you may find it useful to revise the following programming building blocks:

- [Program](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence-and-data/1-concepts/00-program): the idea of building your own programs.
- [Method](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence-and-data/1-concepts/02-method): calling methods from libraries.

It is also important that you understand the following terminology:

- [Statement](/book/part-1-instructions/2-communicating-syntax/1-concepts/02-statement): in instruction performed in your code.
- [Type](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence-and-data/1-concepts/06-type): a kind of data used in your code.

Once we have explored the new programming concepts, we will see how we can use them together to [improve our change calculator](/book/part-1-instructions/3-control-flow/2-put-together/01-0-change-calculator/) and [build a small game](/book/part-1-instructions/3-control-flow/2-put-together/02-00-fly-catch).

## Learning Goals

By the end of this chapter you should be able to:

- Use branching and looping control flow statements.
- Design algorithms to achieve required outcomes.
- Demonstrate how a given algorithm functions and explain the purpose of the control flow statements it is using.
- Use the debugger to explore control flow within a program.
